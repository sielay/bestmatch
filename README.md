# BestMatch

> Wildcards, but reverse.

Most of libs like [wildcard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wildcard) are meant to find elements that match specific pattern. I had use case when I had to find pattern that most accuratelly match given string.

## Install

```
npm i --save bestmatch
```

## Usage

```javascript
var bestmatch = require('bestmatch'),
    patterns = [
            'a.b.c',
            '*.b.c',
            'a.*.c',
            'a.b.*',
            'a.*.*'
    ];

bestmatch(patterns 'a.b.c'); // a.b.c
bestmatch(patterns 'b.b.c'); // *.b.c
bestmatch(patterns 'a.a.c'); // a.*.c
bestmatch(patterns 'a.b.d'); // a.b.*
bestmatch(patterns 'a.z.c'); // a.*.c
bestmatch(patterns 'a.c.d'); // a.*.*
```
